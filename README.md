Trees of the genus <span eid=Q131521>*Rhizophora*</span>, with their characteristic prop-root architecture, are icons of the mangroves. They grow along the coasts in the tropical belt, from Central America to East and West Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Polynesia, in conditions that would be hostile to most plant life. But *Rhizophora* trees have developed remarkable adaptations to the high salinity of seawater and the dramatic fluctuations of the tides. Their aerial roots, called pneumatophores, protect the tree from the force of the waves and have pores, known as lenticels, that open at low tide for gaseous exchange. Like some other mangrove species but unlike the vast majority of plants, *Rhizophora* also demonstrate vivipary—that is, they give birth to live young. The seeds of the *Rhizophora* germinate within their long green propagules, which fall from the tree and float with the sea until they reach a suitable sandy shore and begin to grow. *Rhizophora* live in the vast, teeming tangle of life that is the mangrove ecosystem. Along the Singaporean coastline, their branches are home to migratory seabirds, and when the tides rise, <span eid=Q18596463>tree crabs</span> scuttle up their trunks and silvery <span eid=Q15207743>archer fish</span> dart beneath their roots. When the waters recede, they might reveal a crocodile sunning itself on a mudflat, or any number of well-camouflaged <span eid=Q828079>mudskippers</span>, the semi-terrestial fish whose skittering movements give them away.

Rhizophora—and indeed, all mangrove tree species—have gained significant attention in recent years for their ecosystem services. Mangroves are a hot topic in environmental financialisation frameworks as carbon sinks, and for their utility in protecting coastlines from erosion. This instrumentalist approach to conservation largely ignores the experiences of coastal communities who have long lived with these trees. In Singapore, one of the most common species is Rhizophora apiculata, or “bakau minyak” (oil mangrove) in Malay. Bakau wood is durable and water-resistant, and features heavily in the traditional construction of boats and coastal dwellings by the Orang Laut and Orang Pulau native islander communities.
