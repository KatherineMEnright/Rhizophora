Trees of the genus <span eid=Q131521>*Rhizophora*</span>, with their characteristic prop-root architecture, are icons of the mangroves. They grow along the coasts in the tropical belt, from Central America to East and West Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Polynesia, in conditions that would be hostile to most plant life. But *Rhizophora* trees have developed remarkable adaptations to the high salinity of seawater and the dramatic fluctuations of the tides. Their aerial roots, called pneumatophores, protect the tree from the force of the waves and have pores, known as lenticels, that open at low tide to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Like some other mangrove species but unlike the vast majority of plants, *Rhizophora* also demonstrate vivipary—that is, they give birth to live young. The seeds of the *Rhizophora* germinate within their long green propagules, which fall from the tree and float with the sea until they reach a suitable sandy shore and begin to grow. *Rhizophora* live in the vast, teeming tangle of life that is the mangrove ecosystem. Along the Singaporean coastline, their branches are home to migratory seabirds, and when the tides rise, <span eid=Q18596463>tree crabs</span> scuttle up their trunks and silvery <span eid=Q15207743>archer fish</span> dart beneath their roots. When the waters recede, they might reveal a crocodile sunning itself on a mudflat, or any number of well-camouflaged <span eid-=Q828079>mudskippers</span>, the semi-terrestial fish whose skittering movements give them away.

Along with the Asteraceae, they are one of the two largest families of flowering plants. The Orchidaceae have about 28,000 currently accepted species, distributed in about 763 genera. The determination of which family is larger is still under debate, because verified data on the members of such enormous families are continually in flux. Regardless, the number of orchid species is nearly equal to the number of bony fishes, more than twice the number of bird species, and about four times the number of mammal species.
