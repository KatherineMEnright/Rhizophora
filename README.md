Trees of the genus <span eid=Q131521>*Rhizophora*</span>, with their characteristic prop-root architecture, are icons of the mangroves. They grow along the coasts in the tropical belt, from Central America to East and West Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Polynesia, in conditions that would be hostile to most plant life. But *Rhizophora* trees have developed remarkable adaptations to the high salinity of seawater and the dramatic fluctuations of the tides. Their aerial roots, called pneumatophores, protect the tree from the force of the waves and have pores, known as lenticels, that open at low tide for gaseous exchange. Like some other mangrove species but unlike the vast majority of plants, *Rhizophora* also demonstrate vivipary—that is, they give birth to live young. The seeds of the *Rhizophora* germinate within their long green propagules, which fall from the tree and float with the sea until they reach a suitable sandy shore and begin to grow. *Rhizophora* live in the vast, teeming tangle of life that is the mangrove ecosystem. Along the Singaporean coastline, their branches are home to migratory seabirds, and when the tides rise, <span eid=Q18596463>tree crabs</span> scuttle up their trunks and silvery <span eid=Q15207743>archer fish</span> dart beneath their roots. When the waters recede, they might reveal a crocodile sunning itself on a mudflat, or any number of well-camouflaged <span eid=Q828079>mudskippers</span>, the semi-terrestial fish whose skittering movements give them away.

*Rhizophora*—and indeed, all mangrove tree species—have gained significant attention in recent years for their ecosystem services. Mangroves are a hot topic in environmental financialisation frameworks as carbon sinks, and for their utility in protecting coastlines from erosion.[^1] This present-day conservation vision, which largely excludes traditional human uses of mangrove resources, is the latest entry into a long, contested history of the valuation of tropical coastal lands and their trees. In Singapore, one of the most common species is *Rhizophora apiculata*, or “bakau minyak” in Malay. Bakau wood from this species is durable and water-resistant, and features heavily in the traditional construction of boats and coastal dwellings by the Orang Laut and Orang Pulau native islander communities. Shortly after the arrival of the British in 1819, new fishing technologies arrived on the island as fish became a crucial protein source for a growing settler population. Around Singapore’s waters, there are still a handful of these off-shore fish farms, called *kelongs*—either floating or on stilts, and in both cases made with bakau. In the last several decades, the Singaporean government deemed land along its shores valuable for national development purposes, especially building port infrastructure, military training outposts, and luxury waterfront housing—and evicted coastal and islander communities.[^2] Today, traditional fish farming practices are under threat, with only a handful of fishermen using *bubu* traps; descendants of the Orang Laut are trying to revive cultural memories of coastal life among the mangroves through gatherings around music, folktales, and foodways.[^3] 

This small snapshot of *Rhizophora* mangroves in Singapore reveals how a single tree can be entangled with histories of sea-faring life, food production, colonial control of island coastlines, post-colonial national development goals, and present-day conservation narratives. Expanding on mangrove stories also invites an exciting intersection of the plant humanities and the growing field of "blue," or oceanic, humanities.
